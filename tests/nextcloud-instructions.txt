 🚀  Start the Nextcloud server by running

        $ docker compose up -d nextcloud


 💤  Stop it with

        $ docker compose stop nextcloud


 🗑  Fresh install and wipe all data

        $ docker compose down -v

        Note that for performance reasons the server repository has been cloned with
        --depth=1. To get the full history it is highly recommended to run:

        $ cd workspace/server
        $ git fetch --unshallow
        $ git config remote.origin.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*"
        $ git fetch origin

        This may take some time depending on your internet connection speed.

        You might as well use the script in scripts/download-full-history.sh.
